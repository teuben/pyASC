There are many ways to collaborate using git or in our case github
(skip to the last one, #3, if you don't care about the others)

In the text below, "f1" refers to a file and "b1" refers to a branch and "u1" to a username
For "edit" you will need to pick your favorite editor (vi, emacs, gedit, pico, ....)

1) direct 'git clone' the master (currently peter's) and 'git push' back into
   it.  This is dangerous, needs special permission from the owner anyways.
   but it would be very simple (don't worry, if you're not peter,
   he won't give you permission to push into his repo). This is how CVS
   and SVN work, there is only one repo.

	git clone https://github.com/teuben/pyASC
	cd pyASC
	edit f1
        git commit f1
        git push

   This is the typical workflow if you work on your own repo.

2) A variation on this theme is using a branch, so they could be more safely
   merged into the master. This will be a clean approach.
   So, instead of editing 'f1' in the master, we
   create a branch and make changes on that:


   	git branch b1
	git checkout b1
	edit f1
	git commit f1
	git push -u origin b1      # skip this if you want it only local

   When it comes time to merge, the following sequence can be followed

   	git checkout master        # start from a fresh master
	git pull                   # ensure you are up to date
	git merge b1               # merge in the b1 changes, watch for conflicts
	git push                   # push this new master back to github


3) First in words: fork a master that's not yours in your own GITHUB workspace,
   then clone from that to your laptop, work on a branch, and do a pull
   request on GITHUB from that branch, viz.
   (below your name on GITHUB is "u1")

   	1) go on GITHUB and fork my repo to your space
	   (see the fork button top right)
	   
	   https://github.com/teuben/pyASC


	2) now on your laptop get your own version (as "u1") where you edit
	   on the branch

	   git clone https://github.com/u1/pyASC
	   cd pyASC
	   git branch b1
	   git checkout b1 
	   git branch               # shows you all branch names
	   git branch -r            # shows all branches on remote
	   edit f1
	   git status
	   git commit f1
	   git push -u origin b1    # push it back to your GITHUB


	3) now go back to your GITHUB.COM space, and pick your "b1" branch,
	   and issue a PULL REQUEST
	   Wait for an email when this was merged by the coordinater (Peter for now)
	   When this is done, your b1 branch was merged into the master

        4) Fetch the new master now from the original provider, which we'll label as "upstream"
	   but you can call it anything, it's just a convenient label

	   git remote                                                # see which ones you have
	   git remote add upstream https://github.com/teuben/pyASC   # add this one-time

	   git checkout master                                       # ensure on your master
	   git fetch upstream                                        # fetch the upstream
	   git merge upstream/master                                 # merge in 
	   git status                                                # should be no new things
	   git push                                                  # push it to your origin


         5) If you really don't care about that branch "b1" anymore, it can be deleted.
	    It takes an extra step to do this on the github.com site as well.

	   git checkout master
	   git branch -D b1
	   git push origin --delete b1

	 6) Here's a scenario where you want to peek what another developer is doing on
	    their (github) branch. It can also be used to shotcut between two developers
	    co-developing before a merge on the upstream.

	   git remote add benji https://github.com/BenjiCooper/pyASC # one-time only
	   git checkout -b benji-dev                                 # on your local branch
	   git pull benji BenjiC1                                    # pull in his branch

	   git remote add bsosis https://github.com/bsosis/pyASC 
	   git checkout -b baram-dev
	   git pull bsosis BaramS1
