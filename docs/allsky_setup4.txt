sudo apt-get install libgoocanvas-2.0-dev
sudo apt-get install libxpa-dev
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev

Mesa All Sky Camera setup notes:
--------------------------------
On allsky.lowell.edu
1) installed a vanilla version of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
2) GoQat:
 a) I imported the goqat-2.0.0.tar.gz from canburytech.net/GoQat
    wget http://canburytech.net/GoQat/download/goqat-2.0.0.tar.gz
 b) tar xvfz goqat-2.0.0.tar.gz
 c) Install a bunch of stuff that GoQat will need to compile:




# download ds9 and xpa executables
http://ds9.si.edu/site/Download.html
  e.g.  wget http://ds9.si.edu/download/linux64/ds9.linux64.7.4.tar.gz
        wget http://ds9.si.edu/download/linux64/xpa.linux64.2.1.14.tar.gz

  copy these binaries to /usr/local/bin

f) ./configure
g) make
h) sudo make install
    This installs everything under /usr/local/ by default.

3) SAO DS9: Download ds9 from ds9.si.edu/site/Download.html
   tar xvfz ds9*.gz
   sudo mv ds9 /usr/local/bin

   install libXss for ds9
     yum install libXScrnSaver

   Also install the XPA tools, place those in /usr/local/bin as well.

4) Plug in the Oculus camera to a usb port.  
   The camera will show up on /dev/bus/usb/00M/0NN and the permission
   will need to be made world readable

   csh> sudo chmod 0666 `lsusb | grep Starlight | sed -e 's/://' |\
        awk '{print "/dev/bus/usb/"$2"/"$4}' -`

   this is now implemented in a script in docs/starlight_usb_on

5) install a VNC viewer: (vncviewer)



To work in python you need a few more, if you don't have them:
See also the examples in
   http://indilib.org/develop/tutorials/151-time-lapse-astrophotography-with-indi-python.html


sudo apt-get install subversion python-dev swig cmake

#  sudo apt-get install indi-bin libindi-dev
sudo apt-get install indi-sx
(if indi-sx doesn't exist,  you cannot use that default repository, see below for a private repo that has it)


there's instructions for RPI as well.

apt install:
  libindi-dev

Issues:   in later libindi  it does not come with the needed indi_sx_ccd driver,
better to use this one:


From : http://indilib.org/download/ubuntu.html

From source:  http://indilib.org/download/source/send/2-source/11-3rd-party-indi-drivers.html

From repo:
  sudo apt-add-repository ppa:mutlaqja/ppa
  sudo apt-get update
  # sudo apt-get install indi-full
  sudo apt-get install libindi1 indi-bin indi-sx
       then installs: (~9MB)
                indi-bin indi-sx libindi-data libindi1 libnova-0.14-0


# http://indilib.org/forum/general/13-command-line-client-for-indiserver-indi-sx-ccd.html
It seems, that driver is crashing for some reason.
Usual reason is, that USB device is readonly because of missing 99-sx.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d. Peter

# melissa:
apt install  indi-bin  indi-sx         (does a few other needed)
